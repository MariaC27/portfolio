      "description": "Hello! I'm Maria - a curious college student with the skills of a developer and the mindset of a human-centered designer. In addition to coding, I love being part of the design process as well - finding needs for users or clients, engaging in brainstorm sessions to try to come up with ideas to best suit them, and prototyping (whether it be physical, digital, or experiential) are all things I'm excited about! Thanks for checking out my website and feel free to see some of my projects below. ",
